### Tasks prioritized
I should do this in order

- [x] What's the max resolution I'm designing for?
  - I can't reasonably test above 2532 x 1020, so that's fine for this project
  - NG window on desktop will be 960 x 540, if the others want to change that later then it will be easy to

- [ ] Test ideal size of sprites
- [ ] Test how many animated sprites can exist on screen

- [x] Set up Newgrounds.io
- [ ] uhh can I call NGio.js functions the way it's set up?
