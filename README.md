### Tasks prioritized
I should do this in order

- [x] What's the max resolution I'm designing for?
  - I can't reasonably test above 2532 x 1020, so that's fine for this project
  - NG window on desktop will be 960 x 540, if the others want to change that later then it will be easy to

- [x] Test how many animated sprites can exist on screen
- [x] Test how many sprites of various animations, bigger animations, each with movement code

- [ ] Test ideal size of sprites
Set size of tank, NG window, desktop zoom
- [ ] can the tank be the same size across different resolutions?
- [ ] prototype the most fun ways of interacting with creatures. The gameplay will be focused around them
Fella death function
Death areas which give warnings. Death Chamber flashbacks...

- [x] Set up Newgrounds.io
- [ ] uhh can I call NGio.js functions the way it's set up?

- [ ] Impliment Psychogoldfish's audio hack for safari

### Notes
- camera zoom messes with objects that should stay in place with a scroll factor of 0. I may have to render that stuff in a parallel scene
