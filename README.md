### TODO
- [x] fix white space on top of mobile view / scrollability

### CONSIDERATIONS
- To scale the align gameobjects code to span mutliple scenes, how could I make that code exist as it's own class?

### IDEAS
- what if a game mechanic had to do with mode switching my flipping the orientation, which I can check upon resize? Like different screens the player has to switch between.
